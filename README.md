## Safety and Security of People in CITIES
### Safety and security is among the main concerns in any city
Citizen well being requires that security measures are adequate and law enforcement is well
prepared and trained to effectively combat the breach of law and apprehend the
miscreants.
In our technologically interconnected world and in smart communities of the
future, the scope of the term security is quite broad and is not limited to only
physical security of gated communities. With the increasing risk of cyber-crimes and
data theft, smart cities would have to be prepared to tackle them adroitly. The risk
of identity theft or stealing data would intensify in smart cities if they do not have a
strong security framework.
